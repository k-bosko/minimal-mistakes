Can you imagine living three lives? Well, that’s possible if you are a Life Changer.

I’m living my third life now. The first was in Ukraine. The second – in Germany. And the third one has now started in the Silicon Valley, USA. All three life paths required enormous adaptability and persistence/grit, but would have been impossible without Life Long Learning and a can-do mentality (aka growth mindset). 

I went from the data-analyst-in-the-social-sciences-graduate in Ukraine to academic-researcher and lead-editor-of-online-journal-in-political-science in Germany and now going through another transformation towards data science in the US. 

Why do I want a career change? Having spent a decade in academia, I noticed myself longing for impact. In political science, you analyze trends that might come true or not. But you normally don't have something at stake. I want skin in the game now. Business is the most appropriate environment for this. Since I had a background in analytics, I decided to take it to the next level and graduated from several online specializations on Coursera and Udacity. 

Through online learning, I acquired experience in A/B testing to recommend a menu launch, segmentation and clustering techniques to predict the best store format for a grocery chain, time series forecasting to predict the sale trends. I built classification models to predict loan default risks and ran linear regression models to recommend the catalogue launch. I also extracted enterprise information from the Teradata data warehouse, wrote complex MySQL queries and created several Tableau dashboards, which you can find in my [portfolio](/portfolio/).
