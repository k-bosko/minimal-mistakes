The [INSIGHT Data Science Fellows Program](https://www.insightdatascience.com) helps recent PhDs and Postdocs to find a prestigious job as data scientists in the industry. 
I applied for the fellowship twice, made it to interviews, but was rejected. So I was really curious about who are these top 'quants' and were they landed a job. I scraped the data from the INSIGHT website and did some quick EDA.
